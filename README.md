A Replugged version of Cutecord! Allow certain users, channels, guilds, or even phrases to bypass your discord Do Not Disturb mode

## Features

- Both a positive and a negative filter
- Whitelist/Blacklist based on guild, channel (DMs and categories included), User or even phrase
- Sensitive fallbacks based on status
- Separate muted guilds, channels and categories
- Toggle focused channel exception
- Hear calls from specific people/channels
- Add temporary exceptions

## How it works

This plugin replaces discord's entire notification show/don't show logic with it's own logic.
